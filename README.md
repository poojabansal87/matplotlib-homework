# pyber-analysis
## Python using Pandas and Matplotlib library

# Background

In this activity, we have used a dataset of a ride sharing company that contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type. The objective is to build a [Bubble Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart) that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, the following three pie charts are created:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type

Three observable `data trends` in Pyber data analysis are:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

1. The number of drivers are the highest in Urban cities and comprises of 80.9% of drivers in all the cities combined.
2. Although the number of rides is 68.4% of the total, the fare is 62.7% of the total fare in all cities.  
3. The fare reaches maximum for rides in Rural cities.
